# 👩‍🎓 ML-Driven Clustering of Onboarding Users: Strategies for Enhanced Conversion
Implementation of the "ML-Driven Clustering of Onboarding Users: Strategies for Enhanced Conversion" modules as the part of the bachelor thesis conducted by [Kvitoslava Kolodii]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/kvitkolodii/]) under the supervision of [Tetiana Marynych]([https://www.linkedin.com/in/tetiana-marynych/]). It was submitted in fulfilment of the requirements for the Bachelor of Science degree in the Department of Business Analytics and Information Technologies at the Faculty of Applied Sciences.

## Abstract
Effective onboarding is crucial for user engagement and conversion, yet many applications employ universal strategies that fail to address diverse user needs and motivations. This study investigates unsupervised clustering techniques to segment users based on their interactions during the onboarding process. The thesis is based on anonymised user data from a book summaries mobile application, focusing on key onboarding steps. We apply clustering algorithms, including K-Modes, HDBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, and Spectral Clustering, to identify distinct user segments. Appropriate metrics are applied to evaluate the clustering solutions, and the most effective one is selected for in-depth analysis. The analysis results are then used to generate actionable insights and strategies to enhance the user experience and, therefore, subscription conversions.
